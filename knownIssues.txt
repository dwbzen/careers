UK Game Board:
	AGRIVI Occupation - "Lose 1/2 your cash"
	TECH CONVENTION - change "loose" to "lose"
	Oxford - "Lose next turn"
	Stonehenge Occupation - 
		"Lose next turn"
	

When resolving take_shortcut the player needs to roll or use an experience
from the next_square. Currently it just goes to the next_square and executes it.

Currently entering an occupation requires 2 commands, for example:
  goto Amazon
  enter Amazon
Expand the enter command to go to the occupation first (if not there already)

If player 1 enters an Occupation and rolls (so there's on the Occupation path),
if player 2 lands on that occupation's entry square, the can_bump
logic mistakenly adds player 1 to player 2's can_bump list.
See CareersGameEngine._roll() to fix.

If a player is currently on an occupation entry square, allow the "enter"
command without an argument to enter that occupation.
For example if I'm on square 13 (Amazon occupation entry) I can issue
"enter" instead of "enter Amazon"
If the player is not on an Occupation entry square, return an error.
