When resolving take_shortcut the player needs to roll or use an experience
from the next_square. Currently it just goes to the next_square and executes it.

Allow a player to resolve select_degree at any time after completing college.
This will require pending_action to be a stack instead of a scalar.
For example, you can roll out of college, hit the Travel square and
advance to Buy Insurance on the automatic roll-again.
buy_insurance is also a pending action, so we have a 2-element stack:
select_degree, buy_insurance.
select_degree can be resolved any time (until the next degree) but 
buy_insurance needs to be resolved immediately. 

Currently entering an occupation requires 2 commands, for example:
  goto Amazon
  enter Amazon
Expand the enter command to go to the occupation first (if not there already)

If player 1 enters an Occupation and rolls (so there's on the Occupation path),
if player 2 lands on that occupation's entry square, the can_bump
logic mistakenly adds player 1 to player 2's can_bump list.
See CareersGameEngine._roll() to fix.

If a player is currently on an occupation entry square, allow the "enter"
command without an argument to enter that occupation.
For example if I'm on square 13 (Amazon occupation entry) I can issue
"enter" instead of "enter Amazon"
If the player is not on an Occupation entry square, return an error.
